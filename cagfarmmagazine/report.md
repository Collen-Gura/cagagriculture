CAG AGRICULTURE NEWS MAGAZINE
NAME: Collen Gura

1.	Introduction
Most images used in this project has been taken from internet and acknowldged accordingly as actual pictures/images are impossible to generate within the specified time. Theses acknowledgements are  in the last section of this report, arranged by the HTML page to which it has been used.

The Structure of the website is as follows:
1. HOME PAGE
   --> Our Story
2. PRODUCTS
3. CROPS AND LIVESTOCKS
   --> Crops News
   --> Livestock News
4. Technical News
5. FARM BASICS

The website magazine, CAG Agriculture Magazine, is created to meet information demands of farmers, and their related stakeholders. Farmers have varying needs and interests depending on areas of interest in agriculture. This has been catered for. The magazine seeks to avoid the stereotype approach of taking one aspect of agriculture, for example, beef or field crops, and run with it. 
Targeted users include farmers, seed oil producers, food processing companies, research entities and institutions (including institutions of higher learning), farming consultants, government and government planners, farmers associations and communities, financial institutions, suppliers, crop and commodity buyers, farm journalists, among others.
This website is based on the original wireframe website of  African Sun with intention of changing it to fit own wireframes, but different from those of African Sun. African Sun structure was considered more appropriate to the design intended than existing agricultural magazines. 
2.	What inspired creation of my website
The main purpose of the magazine is the provision of information to farmers and related stakeholders.
There are technological developments and advances being made in the world that farmers, especially African farmers, and African leaders are not aware of. Increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and Robot Operating Systems (ROS) will affect how farming will be conducted in future. For example, the introduction of autonomous tractors and autonomous farm implements, like the DOT technology into agriculture and farming space cannot be ignored for long. The role of software in agricultural technology development is brought to farmers through the magazines such as this, CAG Agriculture. This creates awareness of what farmers can have and should expect to have. This is covered in the section on “Technical News”. 

The “How to” is a concept borrowed from Farmers Weekly, a South African farmers weekly magazine. In this section, referred to as “Farm Basics”, the magazine covers, through articles and testimonies, information such as how to prepare budgets, how to fund farming operations, how to grow citrus fruits, how to avoid crop diseases, …., among others. Farmers are faced with a mixed bag of vagaries, not to mention climate change, that affect their operations. Provision of such information is at the center of farmers’ survival and sustainable farming operations. 
The magazine will initially be a monthly magazine focusing on featuring one farmer’s operation per issue, in addition to the stories carried in respect of the other areas of the magazine. The initial magazine, the subject of this write up, features CAG Green Valley Estates’ operations, in addition to the other stories.
3.	Ways my website is accessible
To keep the cost low and freely available, the magazine shall initially be accessible electronically. No immediate plans for print-media based copies of the magazine is planned until such time advertising revenues can afford to sustain cost of printing and keeping the magazine freely available. Monetization of the magazine will be considered once traffic volumes exceed 2 million viewers. Initially magazine will be available by logging on caggagriculture.com website.  

4.	Usability of my site:
	1. Site is useful to those who want to follow development in technology. Technical news covers that.
    2. Site is also useful to those who want learn the 'How' of farming. Farm basics page covers this.
    3. Those interested in livestocks are covered under "Livesstock News".
    4. Crops are covered under cropsNews.

5.	What I learnt/found out by myself creating the web site:
This was a Project worth doing for I learnt things that would not normally be taught under any syllabus. What needed to be done to get the web completed had to be investigated. Those areas I needed to learn things fast for the project included the following:
5.1	How to Create a Favicon for My Website
Hitherto, I had no idea how an icon is added on to a web page. After browsing the web page, I came across the web site referred to below.
“A favicon is the little icon or logo that appears in your browser tab. This video shows you step by step how to create one and then upload it to your website
[1] danstools.com ‘Favicon & App Icon Generator’, 2016. [Online]. Available: https://www.favicon-generator.org/. [Accessed: 12- Sep- 2020].



The following steps were taken to create the icon:
5.1	Googled for a site that could assist me to have an icon on my web site. At this  site is available an icon creation App for free:  Favicon & App Icon Generator
5.1.1	I logged into the website and:
5.1.2	 Selected “Choose file” button;
5.1.3	Selected the logo I wanted to convert to an icon;
5.1.4	Except for the radio clickable icon, I clicked all the other icon to selected the specified items;
5.1.5	Pressed the “Create icon” button;
5.1.6	Clicked button to download the created icons; 
5.1.7	Before leaving the site, I copied the code provided for accomplishing this task. Below is the sample of the code copied:
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16 &amp; 32x32" href="images4/cagFavicon.ico.png">  
5.1.8	In Windows folders section, I selected ‘downloads’ folder to track and re-name my downloaded zipped icons file; 
5.1.9	Copied the downloaded, now unzipped, icons file into my images file; Re-named the icon I wanted to use to: cagFavicon;
5.1.10	Linked the icon to my to the HTML page using the above code. I made sure that the icon link ended up with .ico.png.

5.2	How to Embed a YouTube video onto a Website 
[1] D. Hay, ‘How to Embed a YouTube onto a Mobile Website’, 2012. [online. Available: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlH6hENsJGs  [Accessed September-2020]
Here is how I embed my various YouTube videos after watching the video by Deltina Hay:
5.2.1	After ‘Googling’ and identifying the relevant YouTube, accessed the    required video; 
5.2.2	Clicked on the ‘Share’ button;
5.2.3	Copied the displayed HTML code from the page;
5.2.4	Opened my Project directory, selected the relevant HTML page;
5.2.5	Pasted the code on my HTML page. Here is the sample:
<iframe width="1060" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1RqFiW7ypw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
5.2.6	Adjusted the width and height of the video to fit on my page;
5.2.7	Saved and refreshed my web page.

5.3	Downsizing images:
o	How to re-size my images to fit on my pre-determined image-size
o	Web site owned by “Counting Charters” found on this web site: Resize Image in Custom Size
o	Process: 
1.	Created a folder called ‘images’ on my Desktop;
2.	Sourced pictures from my iPhone and from own albums;
3.	Name each and every picture for easy reference in HTML pages;
4.	Check position where the picture is supposed to go on the HTML page and obtain the predetermined size, pixels, for the width and height;
5.	Open the Counting Characters web site “Resize Image in Custom Size”.
6.	Once at the site, click on “Choose an Image to Resize”. This takes you to your folders. Click on the ‘images’ folder and click ‘open’. This takes you back to the web site;
7.	Type the width and height you want for the image in question;
8.	Click on “Resize Image”. Wait while the app recounts the permitted pixels according to your input;
9.	When the app completes the resizing, click on “Click Here to download”;
10.	Go to your downloads and click on the downloaded image, right click on and select ‘rename’ and change the name of the image to what you want it to be;
11.	Finally, drag the image into your images folder and you are done.

6	Use of Placeholders
The  

C/O https://placeholder.com/

How To Use Our Placeholders Just specify the image size after our URL (https://via.placeholder.com/) and you’ll get a placeholder image. So the image URL should look this:- https://via.placeholder.com/150 You can use the images in your HTML or CSS, like this:   
(Be sure to check out our HTML & CSS tutorials at HTML.com, our sister site, if you’re rusty) There are a few simple rules before you use them.

Online Resources on Setting up Wireframes:
In addition to our instructor’s module notes, and from the Futur Academy web site, I obtained guidance in respect of the items discussed below and had to re-visit my web site wireframes. These same principles were incorporated in building the website.
The following were the outcome of my review that assisted me to re-set my wireframes:
1.	Label Symbols used in my wireframe:
o	Box with two lines crossing at the middle - Images
o	Small rectangle - Small headers
o	Big rectangle - Big headers
o	Squiggle lines – text
o	Rectangles with a circled arrow in the middle – Videos

2.	Prompts we must consider:
o	Goals we aim to achieve with each page;
o	Speculate how the user might want to use the page;
o	What user questions our website is going to address;
o	What user emotions are we going to bring about;
o	Making use of the symbols consistently;
o	Establish where our goals and that of the client ‘intersect’.

3.	The goals of my website:
Based on the above theory, I have established the following to be our main goal for the website:
o	That our web site content be such that it invokes or attracts re-visits by our users; 
o	We need user downloads to increase advertising revenue;
o	To educate users to download;
 
4.	Estimate User Goals
o	We all know it is human nature to get something for fee. 
o	Imagine what that free resource might be (e.g. farmers need free agronomic information to avoid consultancy fees, etc.);

5.	Emotions to Invoke
What emotions will the web site invoke? It can give:
o	Assurance (e.g.…if  someone has successfully grown the crop or plantation with same climate and ecosystem as mine, I can do it too.)
o	Relief (Source of knowledge
o	Confidence(I can do it too

6.	For web site to succeed in its goals we must answer the following questions:
o	Which visitors do we seek to attract to the web site ( e.g. farmers, bankers, workers, suppliers, consultancies, commodity brokers, millers, consumers of agricultural food stuffs, government – for food security planning, food canners and processors)?;
o	What will the farmers and other stakeholders get from the web site?
o	What do farmers and related stakeholders (e.g. suppliers, bankers, workers and consultancy want to do with this information?
o	When and how will they need this information?
o	Of the stakeholders, who needs information the most?
o	What information must be carried on which pages and under what headings?
o	Do we need any images and in what form (e.g. pictures or videos, etc.)?;
o	How often is the information needed

7	Taking images with iPhone and Downloading into the images file:
I used my iPhone to take pictures and down load the pictures into my laptop and from my laptop into my images file. 

Process:
1.	Take an iPhone;
2.	Checked for existence of an iPhone utility in my Windows 10 Operating System by connecting the iPhone to the laptop;
3.	Click OK to allow iPhone device to work with the laptop OS;
4.	Allow download of pictures from iPhone to laptop;
5.	Save the pictures. If folder not created, the OS automatically creates a file called ‘Saved pictures’;
6.	Select those you want to use and discard the rest;
7.	Resize all the pictures as explained above, rename each and every picture and copy them into the ‘images’ folder and you’re done;

8	How to get to loop in on the Web page using JavaScript:
o	And how I might do things differently another time.
o	Downsizing images:
